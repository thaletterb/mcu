@brief Module for the ACI Transport Layer interface
@details This module is responsible for sending and receiving messages over the ACI interface of the nRF8001 chip.
 The hal_aci_tl_send_cmd() can be called directly to send ACI commands.


The RDYN line is hooked to an interrupt on the MCU when the level is low.
The SPI master clocks in the interrupt context.
The ACI Command is taken from the head of the command queue is sent over the SPI
and the received ACI event is placed in the tail of the event queue.
